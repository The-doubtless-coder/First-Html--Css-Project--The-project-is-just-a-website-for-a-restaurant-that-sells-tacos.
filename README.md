# First-Html--Css-Project--The-project-is-just-a-website-for-a-restaurant-that-sells-tacos.

I think the title says it all.

The project is a just a simple website made in html and css that can help a restaurant, say the Taco litte shop, highlight to its customers when its open, how much tacos in the shop cost and information about the taco shop itself.
